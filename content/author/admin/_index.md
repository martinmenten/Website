I recently joined the [BioMedIA](https://biomedia.doc.ic.ac.uk/) group at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/) as a postdoctoral researcher. Working together with [Professor Daniel Rueckert](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/d.rueckert), I am exploring the use of deep learning to advance the understanding and diagnosis of age-related macular degeneration, the leading cause of blindness in the elderly.

Previously, I received my PhD in physics from the [Institute of Cancer Research](https://www.icr.ac.uk) in 2018. In the team  of [Professor Uwe Oelfke](https://www.icr.ac.uk/our-research/researchers-and-teams/professor-uwe-oelfke), I researched strategies to adapt external beam radiotherapy to anatomical changes in real-time in order to increase cure rates and reduce side effects of cancer treatments.

Before that, I obtained my Master's degree in physics at [Heidelberg University](https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/de) in 2014, while completing research projects at the [German Cancer Research Center](https://www.dkfz.de) and [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu).
