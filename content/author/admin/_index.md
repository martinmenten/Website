I am an independent research group leader at the [Technical University Munich](https://www.tum.de). My group is funded by the [Emmy Noether Programme](https://www.dfg.de/en/research-funding/funding-opportunities/programmes/individual/emmy-noether) of the German Research Foundation and is hosted at the [Institute for AI in Healthcare and Medicine](https://www.aim-lab.io). I also have a secondary affiliation with [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk).

My research focuses development and application of machine learning algorithms for the fields of medical imaging and ophthalmology. I am particularly interested in weakly and self-supervised learning to address data scarcity in healthcare and the integration of multimodal clinical data with medical images.

I studied physics at the [University of Heidelberg](https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/en) from 2008 to 2014. Subsequently, I earned my PhD from the [Institute of Cancer Research](https://www.icr.ac.uk) in London, where I developed automated strategies to adapt external beam radiotherapy for cancer to anatomical changes. After completing my doctoral studies in 2019, I transitioned into computer science by joining the [Biomedical Image Analysis](https://biomedia.doc.ic.ac.uk) group at Imperial College London. In 2021, I moved to the Technical University of Munich, where I established my own research group in 2024.
