I lead the AI for Vision group that focuses on the development and application of machine learning algorithms for the fields of medical imaging and ophthalmology. We are particularly interested in weakly and self-supervised learning to address data scarcity in healthcare and the integration of multimodal clinical data with medical images.

Currently, the group consists of six PhD students:

- Alexander Weers
- Andrea Posada CÃ¡rdenas
- David Mildenberger (co-supervised with Professor Daniel Rueckert)
- Lucie Huang
- Linus Kreitner (co-supervised with Professor Daniel Rueckert)
- Wenke Karbole
